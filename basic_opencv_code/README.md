## Basic Functionality of Open-CV

- `interpolation_image_technique.py`: This Python script demonstrates various interpolation techniques for image resizing or scaling. It showcases methods such as nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolation, allowing you to understand and compare the visual effects of each technique.

- `masking_on_image.py`: This Python script illustrates how to apply masks to images using OpenCV. It demonstrates techniques for creating binary masks, applying them to images, and achieving selective image filtering or region-of-interest extraction.

- `np_array_basic.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook provides a basic introduction to NumPy arrays. It covers concepts such as array creation, indexing, slicing, element-wise operations, and array manipulation, serving as a primer for working with NumPy arrays.

- `sift_detector.py`: This Python script showcases the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for keypoint detection and feature extraction in images. It demonstrates how to detect and describe keypoints, match features, and apply SIFT-based object recognition.

- `morphological_operation.py`: This Python script explores morphological operations in image processing using OpenCV. It demonstrates techniques such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing, along with applications such as noise removal, edge detection, and object segmentation.

- `motion_blur.py`: In this Python script, you'll find an implementation of motion blur effect on images using OpenCV. It provides examples of generating motion blur in different directions and intensities, simulating the effect of camera or object motion during image capture.

- `data_image`: This directory contains additional data files related to image processing. It may include sample images, datasets, or any other relevant files used in the scripts or notebooks mentioned above.

- `video_read_right.py`: This Python script demonstrates how to read and process video files using OpenCV. It covers techniques for reading video frames, performing operations on each frame, and saving the processed video back to a file.
